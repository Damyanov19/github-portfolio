To compose a point class with member variables: h and y coordinates, name (*char). Class Methods:
constructors, destructor. Create a circle class with member variables: coordinates of center(point), radius and color.
Class methods: constructors, destructor, override << operation for circle visualization,
determining the distance between the point and the center of the circle, redefining an operation -, so,
that returns the face of the bisected circle.

To compose a main function that creates several objects of class circle,
outputs the circles in increasing order of the distance from the point to the centers of the circles.
To test an operation â€“. Data to be stored in the file.
