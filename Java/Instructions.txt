To model a system (server) for processing scholarship documents. You have complete freedom in solving the specific problem, except for the minimum requirements below:

In general, the documents contain:

Name;
Good luck;
Income (per 1 family member);
Faculty;
Additional fields for your convenience.
Documents (requests) to be stored in a queue. When a client (student) connects to the form processing server, the server declares its functionality:

Apply for a Success Scholarship;
Apply for a special scholarship;
The document is sent to the student office. From there they decide whether the candidate meets the necessary conditions. 2 secretaries work in the office. Each of them takes a selected form and accordingly the form is reported in the system as taken, respectively locked - it is removed from the queue of forms waiting for approval.

CONDITIONS FOR RECEIVING A SCHOLARSHIP:

A success scholarship is awarded to all students with a GPA above 5 and 50, and a corresponding income of a family member - below BGN 500.
A special scholarship is awarded to all students with a GPA above 5.30 and an income per family member below BGN 300.
Each student is eligible for a maximum of 5 Special Scholarships, provided they take a Success Scholarship and 4 Special Scholarships, provided they do not take a Success Scholarship.
If everything is fine with the scholarship application, the secretary writes the form in a list of accepted applications, and if there is a problem - it is written in a list of incorrect applications.

Note that the server must be multi-threaded to host more than one client (students or secretaries). Provide authorization - you have two types of users - students with rights to submit documents and secretaries - with rights to accept documents.
